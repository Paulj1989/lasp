# The Problem {data-background-color="#425563" data-verticator="#E8EDEE"}

Public Data is "Available" but Not "Accessible"

## Capacity and Access Improvement {.center}

- PCNs qualify for a Capacity and Access Improvement Payment if they can demonstrate improvement (or high achievement) in three areas:
  - Patient experience
  - Ease of access
  - Demand management
- They must undertake "trend analysis" on GP Patient Survey (GPPS) data over the last five years to qualify
- They are struggling to do this, for several reasons

## Access to GPPS & FFT Data {.center}

- GP Patient Survey and Friends & Family Test (FFT) data is publicly available but difficult to work with
- This makes it difficult (and time-consuming) for PCNs to access the data, let alone analyse it
- Wrangling Excel spreadsheets is time-consuming and painful - this is a problem across the entire NHS!

## Limited Analytics Capabilities {.center}

- Not all PCNs have the capabilities to carry out the required analysis, especially given the difficulty accessing the data
- This is especially the case if they do not have their own data analysts
- They may be missing out on vital funding
- How do PCNs make best use of what is available?

# The Solution {data-background-color="#425563" data-verticator="#E8EDEE"}

PCN Capacity & Access Improvement Payment (CAIP) App

## Making the Data & Analysis Accessible {.center}

- We created an app that makes it easier for PCNs to access the GPPS & FFT data 
- The app includes visualisations of trends, with simple, user-friendly customisation
- This significantly reduces the effort required to turn this very useful but inaccessible data into real value for PCNs

## Enabling PCNs Beyond the App {.center}

- The app itself is a useful snapshot of national, regional, ICB, PCN, and GP practice performance, but making this data as valuable as possible involves enabling PCNs to use it outside the app too

- Everything shown to the user is downloadable, and the data is formatted such that it should significantly reduce PCN workloads
- Everything is open source - an increasing priority in the NHS [@goldacre2022]

Addressing the CAIP App's Limitations

## Analysis Without Comparison {.center}

- The CAIP app is a good start, but it lacks meaningful comparisons
- How do you know a GP practice is performing well (or not) without comparing against other GP practices?
- Comparing against national averages, or other GP practices in the local area, is limited at best

## Comparisons Using Public Data {.center}

- We sought to make comparisons between practices based on factors that were likely to impact their performance and the challenges they face: 

:::: {.columns .small}

::: {.column width="33%"}
- Patients:
  - Proportion Male/Female
  - Age Group Proportions
  - Approx Mean Age
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
- Staff:
  - Total Staff & Breakdowns
  - Staff/Patient Ratios
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
- Socioeconomic Factors:
  - Rural-Urban Classification (RUC)
  - Deprivation (IMD)
:::

::::

- While some of the features were engineered, all of the data is publicly available

## Clustering GP Practices {.center}

- Using K-Means clustering, we were able to group GP practices into three clusters:
  - **Urban - High Deprivation**
  - **Urban - Mid- to Low-Deprivation**
  - **Rural**

- Evaluation metrics & validation against GPPS data support our findings
- Clusters are also consistent with existing academic research [@booth2021]

Extending the Capability of the App & Model

## Incorporating Clusters into the CAIP App {.center}

- We will enhance the CAIP app using the GP Practice Similarities Model:
  - Visualising GP practice performance with comparisons against the average performance of their cluster
  - Identifying the $n$ most similar practices using distances within clusters
  - Making clusters clearly interpretable and using them to help practices frame their performance and the challenges they face

## Extending/Improving the Model {.center}

- There are a wide range of potential use cases in Population Health Analytics and across SCW
- The model is in the relative early stages of development - it can definitely be improved in future iterations
- There is a lot of public data that we are not making full use of, whether it be as features in the model or for validation purposes
  - We plan to explore the use of QOF data and ONS Area Classifications data

## Expanding Access to GPPS & FFT Data {.center}

- Public data should be easier for analysts to access - and it shouldn't require so much work to turn it into something useful!
- We plan to build an API to make access to the GPPS & FFT data easier
- It will follow tidy data principles, to ensure it is immediately valuable to analysts
- In the future, we would like to build R and Python packages for accessing the data
